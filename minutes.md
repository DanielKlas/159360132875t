# Meeting Minutes for Software Engineering Methods
## Responsible: Daniel & Saul

### Meeting 1 | 14/01/2020 | 15:20-18:00

#### Group members established:
  -	Daniel Klas
  -	Saul Rennie

  -	Philip Twaddle

- Discord group established
- GitHub repository created 

#### Roles assigned:
-	Product owner is: Philip
-	Scrum master: Connor
-	Minutes: Daniel

- The group discussed ideas for a GUI implementation. A prototypical design we came up with was to use seperate input boxes employing 
numeric input, drop-down menus etc to concatenate several variables into an SQL statement
  - The advantage of this is that any inexperienced users are prevented from writing unintelligible SQL code, since it is mediated by input
constraints

### Meeting 2 | 17/01/2020 | 13:00-14:00

- Reviewed GitHub repository structure
- Discussed task priorities for setup of Mavis, Travis, use of Kanban board 
- Philip has created the Backlog, so we discussed how to proceed with using it
- Handed out tasks, including establishment of a contribution log

### Meeting 3 | 21/01/2020 | 13:00-14:00

- Connor was absent and had notified us in advance, so this was expected
- Had a misunderstanding of location for the meeting, so Philip was unexpectedly absent. He apologised in Discord
- Saul & Daniel briefly discussed the plan for the lab and began distributing tasks. Agreed to do joint work on meeting minutes
- Reviewed Daniel's preliminary GUI design. Saul suggested that having several input/drop-down boxes does not allow for UNION statements,
- or for more complex SQL queries, and proposed also having a plain input box which parses text straight to SQL rather than compositing several variables into a query. This would allow more advanced users to build some of the more complex queries given in use-case specifications in the assessment document.
