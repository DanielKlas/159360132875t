- The group discussed ideas for a GUI implementation. A prototypical design we came up with was to use seperate input boxes employing 
numeric input, drop-down menus etc to concatenate several variables into an SQL statement
  - The advantage of this is that any inexperienced users are prevented from writing unintelligible SQL code, since it is mediated by input
constraints
